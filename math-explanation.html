	<h1>The magic animation numbers explained</h1>
	<h5>Disclaimer: I tried to explain this as best as I could, but I'm not a math teacher. However, if you understand quadratic formulas you'll probably be fine. (There's a TL;DR at the bottom for lazy people)</h5>

	<h2>Formulas</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li><h4>\({F}(x) = {P}*{x}^{2} - R\)</h4></li>
			<li><h4>\({P} = \frac{-1}{ x_{0}^{2} - x_{1}^{2} }\)</h4></li>
			<li><h4>\({R} = {P}*x_{0}^2\)</h4></li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	
	
	<h2>Variables</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>\({F}\): The factor to multiply the maximum cone size with</li>
			<li>\({x}\): The current progress percentage of the animation (0-1, a value of 1 means that the regeneration is complete)</li>
			<li>\(x_{0}\): <i>Percentage</i> at which the cones <i>start</i> growing</li>
			<li>\(x_{1}\): <i>Percentage</i> at which the cones are at their <i>maximum</i> size</li>
		</ul>
		Variables \({P}\) and \({R}\) are the equivalent of \({a}\) and \({c}\) in a standard quadratic formula (\( {a}{x}^{2} + {b}{x} + c \)) respectively. I called them \({P}\) and \({R}\) because reasons. Deal with it.
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h2>Explanation for \(F(x)\) and the meaning of \(P\) and \(R\)</h2>
	<p>
		To determine the size of the cones at a particular point in time we need to calculate a scale factor, which is what this formula is for.
		It's a simple quadratic formula, with parameters \({P}\) and \({R}\) for changing the properties of the growing-phase.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that the <i>effective primary and secondary scales</i> are calculated using:
		<ul>
			<li>\(S_{1}({x}) = clamp({F}({x}), 0, 1) * 4 \) for primary.</li>
			<li>\(S_{2}({x}) = clamp({F}({x}), 0, 1) * 6.4 \) for secondary.</li>
		</ul>
		Nothing exciting there. It clamps the factor from \(F(x)\) within the range of \( [0,1] \) and multiplies it with the maximum scale factor for that cone.
	</p>

		<h3>Why not use a linear formula?</h3>
		Because it's ugly. The cones would grow way too fast at the start and too slow at the end. It just looks very weird.<br>
		By using a quadratic formula we circumvent this, as a quadratic formula start slow but speeds up the further you go.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<h3>So what are \(P\) and \(R\)?</h3>
		<div style="overflow:auto; margin-bottom: 2em; vertical-align: middle;">
			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8F3GDca.png" style="float: left; height: 250px; margin-right: 10px;">
			By manipulating the \(P\) parameter we can determine the steepness of the parabola, enabling us to lengthen or shorten the 'growing period' as we wish.
			As you can see in the image to the left, the blue line (with a \(P\) of \(2\)) reaches the maximum value of \(1\) earlier than the red line.
			This means that a higher \(P\) value in our formula corresponds to a shorter growing period.
		</div>
		
		<div style="overflow:auto;">
			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BFSJTZv.png" style="float: right; height: 300px; margin-left: 10px;">
			We don't want our cones to start growing immediately, because that looks very weird. With \(R\) we can shift our parabola downwards.
			Why is this useful? Because this causes \(F(x)\) to be negative at the start of the animation.
			By <i>clamping</i> the factor back to \(0\) when calculating the effective factors, we create a line that looks like the one to the right.
			As you can see, if \(x &lt; 0.32\) then \(y\) = \(0\). For our purposes this means that the scale factor (and thus the cones) will start growing at \(x = 0.32\) (32% of the animation).

	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h2>Explanation for the formula of \(P\) and \(R\)</h2>
	<p>
		Now that we know how to manipulate our line/scale factor using \(P\) and \(R\) we of course want to know what to set these variables to.
		We need a formula that takes
		<ul>
			<li>- The point where the growing starts (\(x_{0}\))</li>
			<li>- The point where the cones are fully grown (\(x_{1}\))</li>
		</ul>
		as inputs, and our \(P\) and \(R\) values as output, to pop into our \(F(x)\) formula.<br>
		This results in the following system of equations:
		<ul>
			<li>
				\(
				\left\{ 
				\begin{array}{c}
				F(x_{0}) = 0
				\\ 
				F(x_{1}) = 1
				\end{array}
				\right. 
				\)
			</li>
		</ul>

		or more usefully:
		<ul>
			<li>
				\(
				\left\{
				\begin{array}{c}
				0 = {P}*{x_{0}}^{2} - R
				\\ 
				1 = {P}*{x_{1}}^{2} - R
				\end{array}
				\right. 
				\)
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		We can now solve this system:		
		<ul>
			<li>
				\(
				\left\{
				\begin{array}{c}
				0 = {P}*{x_{0}}^{2} - R
				\\ 
				1 = {P}*{x_{1}}^{2} - R
				\end{array}
				\right. 
				\)
				
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				
				\(
				\begin{matrix}
				&times;1 \\
				&times;-1 \\
				\end{matrix}
				\)
				
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				
				\(
				\left\{
				\begin{array}{c}
				0 = {P}*{x_{0}}^{2} - R
				\\ 
				-1 = {P}*{-x_{1}}^{2} + R
				\end{array}
				\right. 
				\)
				
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				
				\(-1 = ({x_{0}}^{2} - {x_{1}}^{2}) * P \)
				
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				
				\(P = \frac{-1}{ x_{0}^{2} - x_{1}^{2} }\)
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		And there is our formula for \(P\)!<br>
		For \(R\) we simply go:
		<ul>
			<li>
				\(0 = {P}*{x_{0}}^{2} - R\)
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				\(R = {P}*{x_{0}}^{2}\)
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	<h2>Summary / TL;DR</h2>
	Using the formulas for \(P\) and \(R\) we can manipulate the start and finishing point of our animation.
	Because it's a waste to calculate these values every tick, they are pre-calculated and in the code as "magic" numbers.
	However we have now discovered that instead of magic, it was math all along.
	
	
	
	<h2>Some useful values for \(x\)</h2>
	<ul style="list-style-type:initial;">
		<li>\(0.05\) when the head finishes rotating</li>
		<li>\(0.075\) when the arms finish rotating</li>
		<li>The formula for the rotation of the arms is \(\alpha = \frac{x}{85}*0.075\)</li>
		<li>The formula for the rotation of the head is \(\beta = \frac{x}{50}*0.05\)</li>
	</ul>
