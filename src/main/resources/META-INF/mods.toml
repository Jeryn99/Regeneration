Inspired by a totally-not-at-all popular British television show (Doctor Who), this mod allows you to obtain the regeneration of powers of a 'Timelord'. Once you obtain these powers, you will regenerate into a new body instead of dying. However, this process will only occur 12 times, after which you will die for real.
